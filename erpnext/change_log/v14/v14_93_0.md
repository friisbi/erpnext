# End of Life reached

With the release of ERPNext version 16, version 14 has reached it's end of life.

This means that version 14 of ERPNext (which is running on this site) will no longer receive critical bug fixes and is no longer covered under Frappe Support.

We highly recommend that you update to version 16 to get the latest bug fixes, features and other improvements.
